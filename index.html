                So recently, I noticed that Meta has introduced his latest spyware on their app Whatsapp, which is the primary communication app for crores of people. We have already seen many agreements on WhatsApp for its users data and privacy. Now, with this new tool, I am more concerned with the impact of this on youth and those who are not so techy and who are suffering from loneliness. And I don't like that circular gradient icon on my home screen of the app; if I want to use it, then I should have an option to turn it off or on. They should ask us for these new tools, especially for AIs, why they are forcing us to use their bots so we can addict/waste our time/lose our data? And the funny is that we can't do anything against it; we can just shout and use their app. <br>
                The only option that I found is to move on from their services and use other alternatives, and the best I found is Signal or Telegram. Telegram is already popular among many Indians, and another one is Signal, developed by a former developer of WhatsApp. It's open source and free. It's known for its privacy policy and user data protection. Signal is easy to use and has simple UI; recently, I found WhatsApp's UI more complex. So now it's time to respect your data.
